A lightweight Java Swing slideshow used as the product increment
for learning and applying Agile/Scrum in CS-250 at SNHU.  

## Features
* Browse destinations with **Next / Previous** buttons.  
* Display location name and a short description.  

## Skills Demonstrated
• Scrum ceremonies (backlog grooming, planning, review, retro)
• User-story writing & estimation (Story Points)
• Basic Java Swing GUI programming
• Continuous integration mindset (builds on every commit)

## Interpreting User Needs
To interpret user needs, I start by actively listening to what users are asking for, not just what they say, but also the problems they’re trying to solve. This means asking follow-up questions, observing how they use current systems, or reviewing feedback from previous versions of a product. Once I understand the needs, I break them down into specific features or tasks the program should handle. Then I prioritize those needs and translate them into code by designing functions, interfaces, or workflows that directly address the user's goals.

### User Stories
User stories help make user needs super clear and focused. They usually follow a format like:
“As a [type of user], I want to [do something] so that [goal or reason].”
This structure keeps development centered around the user's perspective instead of just building random features. It also makes it easier to communicate with the team and stay aligned on what matters most. User stories are short, simple, and flexible.

## How I Approach A Project
I start by understanding the problem deeply. Then I plan out the structure of the program: what components are needed, how they’ll interact, and how to make it scalable or maintainable. I try to build in small chunks, test as I go, and get feedback early and often. I also like using tools like flowcharts, mockups, and pseudocode to map things out before diving into the actual coding.

## Being a Good Team Member
Being a good team member means more than just writing solid code. It’s about communicating clearly, supporting teammates, and being reliable when it comes to deadlines or responsibilities. Good team members give and receive feedback without ego, collaborate on solving problems, and keep the team’s success above personal credit.

## Academic Integrity
