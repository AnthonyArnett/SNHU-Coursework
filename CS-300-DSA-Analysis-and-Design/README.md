# CS300 - DSA: Analysis and Design

### What was the problem you were solving?

The main goal of this course and project was to design and implement a program that helps academic advisors manage course information more efficiently. The program needed to read data from a file, store it in an appropriate data structure, and allow users to view all courses or look up individual course details and their prerequisites.

### How did you approach the problem?

I started by breaking the requirements into smaller parts; loading data, storing it, sorting, and then displaying it. I used a binary search tree as the main data structure since it keeps data sorted and allows fast searching and insertion.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks?

Some challenges included parsing the CSV file, handling missing or extra data, and making sure the program didn’t crash with bad input. I solved these by testing frequently, adding input validation, and breaking complex parts into smaller helper functions.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project helped me think more carefully about program structure and planning before coding. It showed the importance of using algorithms and data structures together, and that software design isn’t just about writing code that “works,” but writing code that’s efficient and easy to follow.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I learned to keep functions focused on one task, use consistent naming, and add short, meaningful comments. My code now follows a cleaner structure that’s easier for someone else (or future me) to read and modify.
