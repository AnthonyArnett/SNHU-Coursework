## The Gaming Room: Draw It or Lose It

### Client & Requirements

The client, _The Gaming Room_, wanted a web-based version of their drawing game _Draw It or Lose It_. The game needed to support multiple teams and players, enforce unique names, and only allow one active game instance at a time. It also had to run smoothly in a browser across desktop and mobile devices, with sketches progressively revealed on a timer.

### What I Did Well

I believe I did well in capturing the requirements clearly and applying design patterns to enforce uniqueness and manage resources. My documentation explains these choices in a way that would make sense both to a client and to a developer.

### Helpful Parts of the Process

Working through the design document gave me a roadmap for coding. Thinking ahead about requirements, constraints, and architecture prevented me from diving in blindly. It showed me how valuable it is to map out relationships between entities and how they’ll interact before touching the code.

### What I Would Revise

If I could revise one part, I would expand the System Architecture View. Adding a clear diagram of subsystems and communication flow would make the design easier to understand at a glance.

### Interpreting User Needs

I focused on the client’s need for scalability, cross-platform usability, and smooth gameplay. User needs shaped every design choice, from enforcing unique names to planning responsive design for different devices. Meeting user needs is essential, even well-written code is useless if it doesn’t solve the user’s problem.

### My Approach to Design

I approached the design step by step: gather requirements, apply patterns, consider platforms, and evaluate tradeoffs. In the future, I’d continue to use this structured approach while also incorporating more visual models (UML diagrams, sequence diagrams) to communicate the design faster and more clearly.
