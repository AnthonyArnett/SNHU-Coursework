# CS255 - System Analysis and Design

##  DriverPass

### Client & Requirements
The client was **DriverPass**, a company that wanted a system to help students prepare for their DMV driving tests. They asked for a cloud-based system where students could take practice exams online, book driving lessons, and track their progress. The main goal was to lower DMV failure rates by giving students better tools to study and practice.

### What I Did Well
I think I did well at laying out the requirements clearly. I made sure to capture both the functional needs (like scheduling lessons and tracking progress) and the nonfunctional needs (like security, performance, and system reliability). I also tied these into diagrams and technical details so developers would have a clear picture of how it should all fit together.

### What I Would Revise
If I could improve one thing, I’d spend more time on the UML diagrams. Some of them are a little too high-level. Adding more detail to the activity and sequence diagrams would make it easier for developers to understand exactly how users move through the system.

### Interpreting User Needs
I took the interview with DriverPass and translated what they asked for into specific system features. For example, their concern about DMV failure rates led to features like practice tests and automatic DMV content updates. It’s important to focus on user needs because if the system doesn’t solve their problem, it won’t be useful, no matter how well it’s built.

### My Approach
My approach is to gather requirements first, then model both how the system works and how it’s structured. In the future, I’d like to use more prototyping and user feedback early on. That way, I can confirm the design really matches what the client wants before too much development work happens.
