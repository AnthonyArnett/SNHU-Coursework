**_Final project for CS-210 (SNHU). C++ program to track and display grocery item frequencies from a file._**

# Overview
This C++ program tracks grocery item purchases for the fictional Corner Grocer store. It reads a daily purchase file, counts item frequencies, allows item lookup, displays all item frequencies, prints a histogram, and saves backup data to a file.

# What I Did Well
* Used a clean object-oriented design with a GroceryTracker class
* Handled file I/O with error checking
* Followed best practices for code readability and structure

# Potential Improvements
* Add better input validation
* Make searches case-insensitive
* Improve scalability for larger files

# Challenges
Working with maps and file handling in C++ was initially tricky. I overcame this through extra practice, documentation, and testing small code blocks separately.

# Transferable Skills
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* File I/O management
* Program design and debugging

# Maintainability
I kept the code clean with in-line comments, modular structure, and consistent naming conventions, making it easy to update or extend later.
